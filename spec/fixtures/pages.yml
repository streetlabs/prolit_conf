  content: ! "<p>\n  The proletarian arts movements our project focuses on were
      a major force in cultural, social\n  and political life in many countries including
      Canada, and they continue to resonate with\n  struggles for recognition and
      social justice today. New generations of workers and artists may\n  find inspiration
      and solidarity with those who have come before.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In conjunction
      with the academic Conference at the University of Alberta, we are organizing
      a\n  Proletarian Arts Festival, with locations and events throughout the city
      of Edmonton,\n  26 August - 1 September 2012. The festival is also affiliated
      with the Alberta Federation of Labour’s\n  <a href=\"http://www.afl.org/index.php/About-AFL/project-2012-celebrating-100-years-of-labour-in-alberta.html\">Project
      2012</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Through the festival, we are invested in gathering shared
      audiences and participants from among\n  the arts, labour, and activist communities
      in Edmonton. Planned events include a mini film festival,\n  a documentary screening
      and discussion, readings with local writers, exhibitions by local worker-artists,\n
      \ archival displays, a hands-on printmaking workshop, and choral and theatrical
      performances. These\n  events will draw conference participants as well as community
      members out of the university and into\n  the streets of the city. Conference
      submissions in artistic genres (visual arts, performance, film, song)\n  are
      also encouraged, as are commentaries and curations of these forms of work.\n</p>\n<p>\n
      \ More information will be made available here as festival organization develops.\n</p>\n"

  content: ! "<p>\n  The Proletarian Arts & Culture International Conference and
      Arts Festival is a two\n  part event including an academic conference August
      30 - September 1 and an overlapping\n  week-long arts festival August 26 - September
      1, taking place at the University of Alberta\n  and participating venues in
      Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The conference and its associated arts
      festival consider proletarian arts and culture here\n  and elsewhere, now and
      in the past. Proletarian arts are understood as those that “represent”\n  the
      proletariat, however defined, in the double and linked sense of “depicting”
      and “speaking for.”\n  These arts include literature in all genres; graphic
      arts; film; theatre, including live performance\n  and radio plays; music, including
      folk music, ballads, opera, orchestral, and other forms;\n  performing arts
      including dance; and applied arts including architecture, urban planning,\n
      \ and industrial design.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Our vision for the conference is to blend
      traditional forms of academic communication\n  (e.g., panels, roundtables, keynotes)
      with artistic exhibitions, cutting-edge workshops, and\n  non-academic speakers
      that will enable unique learning opportunities.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The coordination
      of an arts festival with an academic conference reflects one of our larger project\n
      \ goals: to explore and celebrate proletarian arts and culture in its many forms
      in ways that connect\n  the university with the greater community through publicly
      accessible means of investigation and\n  communication (e.g., workshops, dramatic
      performances, mini film festivals, extra-campus locations\n  and events). We
      are proudly affiliated with the events of Project 2012, launched by the Alberta\n
      \ Federation of Labour (AFL) and the Alberta Labour History Institute (ALHI)
      to mark 100 years of\n  struggle and solidarity in our province.\n</p>\n<p>\n
      \ The international conference and arts festival is part of Proletarian Arts
      & Culture, an\n  interdisciplinary and collaborative research program including
      an online resource centre and a\n  multimedia publication focused primarily
      on working class history and culture from the 1920s to the\n  1940s as well
      as related literature and arts before and since. This work balances the local
      with\n  global movements and legacies, considering arts in different countries,
      political regimes, and social\n  and cultural contexts. The project is based
      at the University of Alberta, under the direction of\n  Dr. Gary Kelly of the
      Department of English and Film Studies, with partnerships at Newcastle University.\n</p>\n"
