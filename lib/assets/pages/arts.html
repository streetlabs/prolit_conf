  The proletarian arts movements our project focuses on were a major force in cultural, social
  and political life in many countries including Canada, and they continue to resonate with
  struggles for recognition and social justice today. New generations of workers and artists may
  find inspiration and solidarity with those who have come before.

  In conjunction with the academic Conference at the University of Alberta, we are organizing a
  Proletarian Arts Festival, with locations and events throughout the city of Edmonton,
  26 August - 1 September 2012. The festival is also affiliated with the Alberta Federation of Labourâ€™s
  <a href="http://www.afl.org/index.php/About-AFL/project-2012-celebrating-100-years-of-labour-in-alberta.html">Project 2012</a>.

  Through the festival, we are invested in gathering shared audiences and participants from among
  the arts, labour, and activist communities in Edmonton. Planned events include a mini film festival,
  a documentary screening and discussion, readings with local writers, exhibitions by local worker-artists,
  archival displays, a hands-on printmaking workshop, and choral and theatrical performances. These
  events will draw conference participants as well as community members out of the university and into
  the streets of the city. Conference submissions in artistic genres (visual arts, performance, film, song)
  are also encouraged, as are commentaries and curations of these forms of work.
